# Exploring Data about Titanic Tragedy
Following the Data Science 1 Nanodegree of Udacity, this project is the exploration of data about the people aboard Titanic when it sunked, after striking an iceberg. The way the ship was built and socially divided, together with the different people aboard, can help us to understand if some groups of people had any leverage in the process of escaping. 

The Exploratoy Data Analysis is done using, mainly, the packages Pandas and Numpy in Python 3.
